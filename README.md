# ICanHazDadJoke_Search

This application will uses the "I can haz dad joke" API (https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) to display jokes. 

The front-end is made as possible and is implemented using WPF App(.Net Framework). The emphasis is on the back-end service to learn how an API can be called. 

All the communication with the icanhazdadjoke API and preparing the data for display is implemented in a back-end service using C# and .NET. 

There are two options the user can choose from:
1. Fetch a random joke.
2. Search for a term and display the first 30 jokes containing that term. The matching term will be emphasized in a simple way (uppercase & angle brackets). The matching jokes are grouped by length: Short (<10 words), Medium (<20 words), Long (>= 20 words)

Thanks,
